# To-do list for Kowhai

## Command-line arguments

Should add these:

* -seed <int> to set the random number generator seed
* something to input an experimental set up with multiple trees, complex linkages between them..

## Conceptual

* Need to think of a way to represent gene tree linkages when duplicating them, more than just "any two or more genes can duplicate together if they're on the same host/species branch".
